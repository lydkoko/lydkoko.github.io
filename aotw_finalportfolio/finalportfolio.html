            <p> Ulises Carrión's Erratic Art Mail International System disrupts traditional postal norms, offering an alternative for artistic expression. E.A.M.I.S., transcends conventional mail services, allowing for diverse formats and mediums, from cards to cassettes. It operates as a free-of-charge, artist-driven initiative, challenging the bureaucratic constraints of official Post Offices. He contends that Mail Art is not just about sending postcards; it's a unique way for artists to express themselves and connect with each other outside of the usual mail system. </p>

                <p> Geocities' trajectory from beginning to end is a reflection of the web's transition from academia to widespread accessibility. As a pioneer of personal websites, Geocities marked many users' introduction to web design through HTML. While initially popular, Geocities fell out of favor with the rise of social media, leading to its acquisition by Yahoo! and eventual shutdown in 2009. It was interesting delving into the Geocities archive, which gives valuable insights into early web culture and aesthetics, and shows the importance of understanding digital history.</p>

                <p>This reading on alt-text poetry showed me that it offers a unique way to bridge the gap between visual and textual experiences, providing a rich and imaginative description of images for those who rely on screen readers. It made me want to be more thoughtful and inclusive in my own design. Poetic alt-text prompts a reevaluation of traditional accessibility practices, emphasizing the importance of creativity, inclusivity, and cultural representation in digital communication. As the field of alt-text continues to evolve, exploring its potential can lead to innovative approaches that enhance the accessibility and aesthetic appeal of online content for individuals of all abilities. </p>

                <p>The text talks about how graphic design has changed over time and suggests "hypermodernism" to describe today's digital-influenced practices. It looks at how designers use Disney images in critical graphic design to criticize how things are becoming the same worldwide. It shows how designers can say a lot with pictures on paper in today's world.</p>

                <p>Tuer's study of Vera Frenkel's "String Games" shows how Frenkel used technology creatively and explored themes like absence and loss. This analysis makes us think about how technology shapes our memories and storytelling. It also makes us question how we judge art in the digital age when considering these themes.</p>

                <p>This talk looks at how things are changing in how we share stuff online, especially focusing on art and experimental publishing. It talks about where the idea of "posting" comes from and how it's evolving with things like live streams and endless feeds. The speaker wants feedback as they try to figure out what all these changes mean. After reading "Beyond Dark Matter," I was captivated by Gem's journey from feeling isolated by technology to finding empowerment through community. The narrative beautifully highlights the complex relationship between technology and society, urging us to reconsider the ways in which we interact with and perceive technology in our lives. </p>
